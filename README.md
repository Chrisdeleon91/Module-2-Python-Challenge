# Module-2-Python-Challenge
I applied the concepts Iâ€™ve learned to complete the required PyBank Python activity and stretched my skills even further by doing the the optional PyRamen Python activity. 
Both activities presented a real-world situation in which my newfound Python skills will come inhandy.


### 1. Go into PyBank folder and launch PyBank.py from a terminal
* A output.txt file exists to show the output of the current program
